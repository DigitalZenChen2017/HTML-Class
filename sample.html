            <h1>Notes From Wikipedia</h1>
            <p class = "wiki"><i>W3C</i> and <b>WHATWG</b> have been characterized as both working together on the development of HTML 5,[14] and yet also at cross purposes[30][2] ever since the July 2012 split of the W3C work into milestone-based static standards and WHATWG's into a continually updated "living standard". The relationship has been described as "fragile", even a "rift",[40] and characterized by "squabbling".[2]
                In at least one case, namely the permissible content of the <cite> element, the two specifications directly contradict each other (as of July 2018), with the W3C definition being permissive and reflecting traditional use of the element since its introduction,[41] but WHATWG limiting it to a single defined type of content (the title of the work cited).[42] This is actually at odds with WHATWG's stated goals of ensuring backward compatibility[43] and not losing prior functionality.[30]
                The "Introduction" section in the WHATWG spec (edited by Ian "Hixie" Hickson) is critical of W3C, e.g "Note: Although we have asked them to stop doing so, the W3C also republishes some parts of this specification as separate documents." In its "History" subsection it portrays W3C as resistant to Hickson's and WHATWG's original HTML 5 plans, then jumping on the bandwagon belatedly (though Hickson was in control of the W3C HTML 5 spec, too). Regardless, it indicates a major philosophical divide between the organizations:[44] I am taking this class at
